TCP can be more specific, searching for specific programs inside a computer not just the computer it's  self.

Every time we go to a page, that is a HTTP request. When the response is gotten by the client (The client is the only initiator of communication it will never be the server) that response cycle his done and will no longer continue untill a new request is made.

Stateless protocals focus on the current request ONLY. It will not be effected by any prior requests.

REST APIs: look into this

Status code is alwas a 3 digit number that falls within the following ranges/catagories
    1xx Informational
    2xx Success
    3xx Redirection
    4xx Client Error
    5xx Server Error
No need to remember all of them, but you will see more common errors often

HTTP request start like so 
GET /sample_page.html HTTP/1.1

HTTP Method (Verb)	Desired Action on Server
    GET	            The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource (URL). Requests using GET should only retrieve data.
    POST	        The POST method is used to create a resource on the server.
    PUT	            The PUT method replaces a resource with the request payload(data in the body). 
    DELETE	        The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.

URL (Unifor Resource Locator)

REPL is an acronym for Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop.

NODEjs is a run time environment so it does not have acess to the DOM or HTML elements

In a Node application, every JavaScript file is a module!
A Node app's modules (files) can be put in any folder within the project.
This allows us to create modules inside of aptly named folders, such as models, routes, controllers, views, etc.

NPM (Node Package Manager)

Dependencies are the things that we need to run our code.
